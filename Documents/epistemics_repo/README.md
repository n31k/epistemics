#Epistemics 
##Factorial Analysis of Personal Epistemology

This is a side-project dealing with high-school students and young graduate adults
'personal epistemologies' (Hofer and Pintrich, 1995). Rather than a set of beliefs, said epistemologies are dealt with
as coherent professional ideologies (Althusser, 1990, 2008), acquired via institutional initiation, after high school. 
A 9-dimensional instrument is constructed on the basis 
of meta-scientific bibliography (Brown, 1993; Hacking, 1983, 1999; Hanson, 1958; Kuhn, 2012; Lakatos, 1980), 
and explored with Principal Components Analysis in young graduate
adults, 12th graders with either humanties or science as a major orientation and 10th graders, without 
specific formal orientation.
